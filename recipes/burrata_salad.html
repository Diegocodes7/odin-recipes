        <p>All you need to know about this tomato and Burrata salad is that burrata means “buttered.” Comparing mozzarella and Burrata is slightly unfair, as Burrata is significantly richer and creamier. It's not like comparing apples and oranges — it's more like apples and supermodels.
        </p>
